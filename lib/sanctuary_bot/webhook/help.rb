        Hello! I'm Sanctuary-Bot. I hang out here, and you can tell me to do stuff. Just simple stuff. I'm not all\
         that sophisticated. Or at least not yet. You can give me commands by starting them with a forward-slash\
         character. Here's what I know how to do so far:

            `/word` - This command tells me to look up and display a scripture passage. For example, you can say\
         `/word Matt 1:20-2:5`.

            `/help` - This command displays help for a topic. For example, you can say `/help word` to display help\
         on the `/word` command that looks up scripture passages.

        If I respond with something like "interaction failed", just try again. It might just be that I'm a bit drowsy\
         and need to be awakened. Discord isn't very nice to bots like me, and if I don't respond fast enough, it\
         calls me a "failure." Can you imagine that? But that said, if I start misbehaving _consistently_, then, uhh,\
         yell at the Google guy. What's his name? Oh yeah, "Daniel". The cat. He can fix me if I'm actually broken.
      TEXT

      WORD_HELP_TEXT = <<~TEXT
        The `/word` command looks up and displays a passage from scripture. You can specify the passage by a range of\
         of chapters and verses. You can abbreviate the book name; I'm pretty good at figuring out which one you're\
         talking about. Here are some examples that I can respond to:
            `/word Matt 1:1`
            `/word Ps 23`
            `/word psalm 1:1-4`
            `/word 1 Jn 1:5-2:6`

        A few caveats, though. If you ask me for a long-ish passage, I might break it up into sections, because\
         Discord doesn't let me display more than 2000 characters at a time. And please don't be mean and ask me for\
         a _really_ long passage. Any more than a few hundred verses, and I might just give up halfway through.

        Finally, for now I'm limited to the _World English Bible_, which is in the public domain. I'm just a bot, not\
         a copyright lawyer. I may get additional translations later, if Daniel can figure out how. Although he's not\
         a copyright lawyer either, the last time I checked.

        Sorry, I don't know much about `TOPIC`. Try asking me about `word`.

         the partner of the cat who wrote me. I'm not biased at all. Really.
